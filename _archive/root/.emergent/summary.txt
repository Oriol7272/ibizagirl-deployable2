The previous AI engineer's trajectory for  primarily struggled with persistent Git synchronization and Vercel deployment issues, which overshadowed numerous feature implementations and design refinements. Initial efforts confirmed local changes, but they repeatedly failed to reflect on the live site or GitHub. The AI attempted various Git commands, confirmed remote configurations, and guided the user on manual Vercel redeploys and DNS settings. Despite confirming local code correctness, the online version remained outdated. Simultaneously, the AI implemented comprehensive feature updates: dynamic content loading, revised PayPal subscriptions, integrated ad networks, updated chatbot, new design (Allura font, ocean colors, wave effects, night mode), and refined UI elements (smaller price/PayPal icons, blur). The core unresolved problem remains the propagation of these extensive local changes to the live  site via GitHub and Vercel, leading to a decision to call the .

The primary objective is to develop beachgirl.pics and BeachGirl.pics as static websites for selling premium images/videos. Content is classified as full (free, daily randomized), uncensored (paid), and uncensored-videos (paid), with 30% of paid content marked NEW. Monetization is via PayPal with specific pricing: monthly (€19.99), annual (€100), and lifetime (€200), with smaller price icons on thumbnails. Four ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds) must be integrated and visible. UI/UX includes blurred premium thumbnails, an Isabella AI chatbot, multi-language support, a tropical age verification, and a Great Vibes hero banner. Google Analytics, SEO (robots.txt, sitemap.xml), and PWA support are essential. Design requirements evolved to include an elegant Allura font style, a color palette restricted to marine/ocean blues and white, wave effects, elegant masks for premium content, micro-interactions, and a night mode feature. Unwanted elements like large price icons, padlock symbols, and specific decorative images (flowers, palm trees) are to be removed or used only as a background. The immediate focus has been stabilizing  and then adapting it for .

- **Static Site Development**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript for client-side rendering and DOM manipulation.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: PayPal SDK for payments, and ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds).
- **Deployment & Version Control**: GitHub for source control, Vercel for hosting, and DNS configuration for domain mapping. Git commands (, , , On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean).
- **Front-end Design**: Responsive design, CSS animations (waves), , , font integration (Google Fonts).

<code_architecture>
The application is a single-page static website primarily built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging pre-existing content files.



-   **index.html**: The core entry point for the static site.
    -   **Importance**: Handles UI structure, content rendering, PayPal integration, ad loading, language switching, and chatbot functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored for dynamic content loading from , implemented precise content rotation (20 full, 100 uncensored with 30% NEW, 20 videos with 30% NEW). PayPal integration was updated for live mode with monthly/annual/lifetime subscriptions (€19.99, €100, €200 respectively), with smaller price icons. Ad network initialization was refined. Chatbot responses updated. Design changes include new Allura font, ocean-themed colors, wave effects, night mode button, and elegant masks for premium content. Elements like large price icons, padlock symbols, multiple subscription buttons, and floating flower/palm icons were removed from thumbnails.  was attempted to be used as a full background instead of distributed icons. Fixed  reference and  duplication. Improved PayPal modal and ad rendering.
-   **styles.css**: Global CSS for styling and responsiveness.
    -   **Importance**: Defines the visual theme.
    -   **Changes**: Adapted for the beachgirl theme, responsive adjustments, and minor style tweaks for price icons. Extensive modifications for Allura font, ocean colors (marine, ocean, sea blue, white), wave animations, night mode styling, elegant masks (), reduced button/icon sizes, and improved blur effects. Specific styles for video thumbnails and simplified content overlays were added. Removed styles related to unwanted decorative icons (flowers, palms).
-   **content-data*.js (content-data1.js to content-data6.js)**: Files holding multimedia content arrays.
    -   **Importance**: Crucial for defining paths to multimedia content and supporting dynamic content display.
    -   **Changes**: Completely regenerated to include all 792 real images/videos. Global  exports were added for accessibility. A  for  in  was addressed.
-   **age-verification.html**: The age verification gate.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures compliance.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use the new color palette and font, and removed old palm tree icons/background elements.
-   **uncensored/, uncensored-videos/, full/**: Directories containing multimedia files.
    -   **Importance**: Store the primary content. The  files precisely list the contents.
-   **Old/Temporary Files**: Many redundant HTML and JS files were systematically deleted (, , , , , , etc.).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to resolve a critical and persistent issue where extensive local code changes were not being reflected on the live  website, despite repeated attempts to  and user-initiated Vercel redeploys. The latest diagnostic confirmed that the local repository contains all the recent changes (e.g., , Allura font, corrected prices, removed palm trees, PayPal fixes, ad display logic), but the  file fetched directly from GitHub (and consequently, the live Vercel site) still showed an outdated version with old elements (e.g.,  with distributed icons, floating palms, old , large prices).

The AI has concluded that the Save to GitHub feature is not working correctly or there's a fundamental Git remote issue preventing local commits from reaching GitHub reliably. The engineer has re-added the Git remote  and confirmed local and remote synchronization (). However, a direct check of  on GitHub still reveals the old code. This indicates a deeper problem with the Git workflow or the interaction between the environment and GitHub, which has prevented all the extensive feature and design work from going live.
