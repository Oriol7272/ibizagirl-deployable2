ATTENTION - SECRETS INCLUDED

This archive has been prepared including sensitive credentials and ad tokens you provided in uploads.
Files to review immediately:
 - .env  (contains PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID and PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET etc.)
 - public/snippets/ads-body.html (contains ad scripts and tokens)

**Security actions you MUST do before committing or pushing to any remote:**
1) Remove .env from repository and add its keys as environment variables in Vercel (Project Settings -> Environment Variables).
2) Rotate your PayPal secret and any ad tokens if they have been exposed publicly previously.
3) Use git history rewrite (BFG or git filter-repo) to remove any sensitive file from previous commits if necessary.
4) Use secure storage for keys (Vercel env, AWS Secrets Manager, Vault).

If you want, I can prepare the exact `git filter-repo` / `bfg` commands to sanitize your git history.
