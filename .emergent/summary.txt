The previous AI engineer's trajectory focused on stabilizing and enhancing  from a provided GitHub repository. Initial efforts were hampered by persistent Git synchronization issues and critical syntax errors in  due to unmerged conflict markers. A significant misstep was the AI's initial failure to utilize existing  files, leading to hardcoded content and user frustration.

The AI successfully regenerated and integrated complete content lists (792 files) into , corrected  to dynamically load content, and added global exports. Despite ongoing user-side GitHub conflicts, the AI guided the user to perform a , which resolved the remote repository discrepancies. Subsequently, the AI implemented precise content rotation logic (20 full, 100 premium with 30% NEW, 20 videos with 30% NEW), fully integrated PayPal for monthly, annual, and lifetime subscriptions with optimized pricing icons, ensured all four ad networks were active, updated the Isabella chatbot, and performed comprehensive file cleanup. The trajectory concludes with all  requirements fully implemented and verified.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop IbizaGirl.pics and BeachGirl.pics as static websites for selling premium images/videos. Content is categorized into full (free, daily randomized), uncensored (paid), and uncensored-videos (paid), with 30% of paid content marked NEW. Monetization is via PayPal (monthly €19.99, annual €199.99, lifetime €100) with specific price icon sizing on thumbnails. Multiple ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds) must be integrated. UI/UX features include blurred premium thumbnails, an Isabella AI chatbot, multi-language support, a tropical age verification, and a Great Vibes hero banner. Google Analytics, SEO (robots.txt, sitemap.xml), and PWA support are essential. A Premium VIP tier for ad-free access is also required. The immediate focus was to stabilize  from a specific GitHub repository, ensuring all features (content counts/rotation, PayPal, ads, chatbot, languages, performance) are fully functional and free of errors, and then to adapt this stable version for .

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Static Site Development**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript for client-side rendering.
-   **Third-Party Integrations**: PayPal SDK for payments; ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds).
-   **Deployment & Version Control**: GitHub for source control, managing Git conflicts (merge markers, force push).
-   **Content Management**: Dynamic content loading, daily rotation logic, NEW content marking.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a single-page static website primarily built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging pre-existing content files.



-   **index.html**: The core entry point for the static site.
    -   **Importance**: Handles UI structure, content rendering, PayPal integration, ad loading, language switching, and chatbot functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained hardcoded content generation. Extensive modifications were made to remove hardcoded content, integrate PayPal (Client ID  for live mode), enable all ad networks, and implement dynamic content loading. Recent edits include updating content rotation logic (20 full, 100 uncensored, 20 videos), configuring monthly/annual/lifetime PayPal subscriptions with smaller icons, and updating chatbot responses. Git conflict markers were removed.
-   **styles.css**: Global CSS for styling and responsiveness.
    -   **Importance**: Defines the visual theme.
    -   **Changes**: Adapted for the IbizaGirl theme, responsive adjustments, and minor style tweaks for price icons.
-   **content-data*.js (content-data1.js to content-data6.js)**: Files intended to hold multimedia content arrays.
    -   **Importance**: Crucial for defining paths to multimedia content and supporting dynamic content display.
    -   **Changes**: Initially incomplete and ignored by the previous AI, these files were completely regenerated to include all 792 real images/videos from the , , and  directories. Global window exports (e.g., ) were added to ensure the content arrays are accessible in .
-   **uncensored/, uncensored-videos/, full/**: Directories containing actual multimedia files (webp, mp4).
    -   **Importance**: Store the primary content. The  files now precisely list the 127 full images, 572 uncensored images (split into two content-data files), and 93 uncensored videos present in these directories.
-   **8179717.html, f67a56f266e834d596c42122f88bb88d.html, 97ce8adfbeb6e153ef4ebf2566dfeb7d.html, eroads__5f8afe77e5b70fec960d89b314e045a4.html**: Ad network verification files.
    -   **Importance**: Essential for ad network integration and verification.
-   **twitter-bot-ibiza/ (directory)**: Contains Twitter bot logic.
    -   **Importance**: Automates content promotion. Not directly modified in this trajectory.
-   **Old/Temporary Files**: (, , , , etc.)
    -   **Importance**: These were remnants from previous iterations or backups.
    -   **Changes**: All identified unnecessary and temporary files were systematically deleted to clean the repository.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed and verified all specified enhancements for the  application. The primary focus was to address persistent content management issues and ensure full monetization functionality.

The key work involved:
1.  **Content Management Overhaul**: The  files were thoroughly updated to include all 792 real multimedia files (127 full images, 572 uncensored images, 93 uncensored videos) from their respective directories. This corrected a critical long-standing issue where content was hardcoded or incomplete. Global  exports were added to these files, making the content arrays accessible to .
2.  **Dynamic Content Display**:  was refactored to dynamically load and display content using the  files, replacing previous hardcoded implementations.
3.  **Content Rotation Logic**: Specific daily rotation requirements were implemented: 20 random full images (without gratis labels), 100 random uncensored images with 30% marked NEW, and 20 random uncensored-videos with 30% marked NEW.
4.  **PayPal Integration**: PayPal was configured for live mode with the provided Client ID. Comprehensive subscription options (monthly €19.99, annual €199.99, lifetime €100) were integrated, and their pricing icons on thumbnails were specifically made smaller.
5.  **Ad Network Activation**: All four required ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, EroAdvertising, PopAds) were verified as fully functional and correctly configured.
6.  **Chatbot Update**: The Isabella AI chatbot was confirmed to be visible and functional, and its responses were updated to correctly reflect the monthly, annual, and lifetime subscription pricing.
7.  **Repository Cleanup**: All identified old, unnecessary, or temporary files and backups (including , , old HTML versions, etc.) were removed from the  directory, optimizing the codebase.

The system's final test results () confirmed that all 20 full images, 100 premium images, and 20 premium videos loaded correctly from the 792 total files. All ad networks, PayPal, and the chatbot were reported as active and optimized. The AI engineer concluded that  is 100% COMPLETE y OPERATIVO and ready for production, indicating that all immediate user requirements for this specific site have been met.
