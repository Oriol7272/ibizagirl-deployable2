The previous AI engineer's work involved a complex, iterative process to migrate and stabilize a static website, initially , then primarily . Key challenges included fixing pervasive JavaScript errors (SyntaxError, TypeError), PayPal integration issues, and errors with multiple ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising). A significant and recurring problem was the inability to reliably synchronize changes to GitHub, which often led to repository corruption or loss of recent modifications, forcing the AI to manually provide code snippets and repeatedly reconfigure Git. Despite fixing critical functionality like content generation, image paths, and PayPal, and ensuring proper branding and performance for BeachGirl.pics, the persistent Git sync issues and the unintended deletion of critical content-data files led to user frustration. The final decision, driven by user feedback, was to pivot to perfecting the  repository first, then porting the stable changes to , acknowledging the inefficiency of previous attempts.

The user requires two static websites, IbizaGirl.pics and BeachGirl.pics, to sell images and videos. Content is tiered: full (free, randomized daily), uncensored (paid, 100 photos), and uncensored-videos (paid, 40 videos), with 30% marked NEW daily. Monetization is via PayPal for one-time purchases, monthly (€19.99), and lifetime (€100) subscriptions, disabling credit/debit. Multiple ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds) must integrate correctly. UI/UX elements include blurred premium thumbnails, an Isabella AI assistant, multi-language support (Spanish, English, French, German, Italian), a tropical-themed age verification, and a hero banner with Caveat and Dancing Script fonts (later changed to Great Vibes). Google Analytics, SEO (, ), and PWA support are needed. A Premium VIP tier for ad-free access is also required. A Twitter bot for promotion was previously fixed. The primary evolving goal was to debug and stabilize , then clone and adapt it for  with unique branding, ad IDs, ensuring a functional, error-free frontend, especially for PayPal and ad integrations, and to resolve GitHub synchronization issues. The latest request is to perfect  first, then copy the functional state to .

-   **Temporary/Generated Files**: Various HTML and TXT files (e.g., , , ) were created by the AI engineer to facilitate manual content transfer due to persistent Git issues.  was a staging directory for a clean GitHub upload attempt. Many of these temporary files caused clutter in the GitHub repository.

<pending_tasks>
-   Switch to  repository.
-   Completely perfect the  site, ensuring all features (PayPal, ads, chatbot, galleries, languages, performance) are fully functional.
-   Once  is perfected, clone and adapt its complete and verified state to , applying specific branding changes for BeachGirl.pics.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to finalize the  website and resolve critical GitHub synchronization issues. After a Save to GitHub operation resulted in a reverted, incomplete version of  on the live site () and the GitHub repository, the AI identified missing features (galleries, Isabella, languages, PayPal buttons, ads) and numerous 404 errors for image assets, along with PayPal  errors.

The AI then performed a series of fixes:
1.  **File Path Correction**: Identified existing image/video files in , ,  and updated  to use these correct paths.
2.  **PayPal Fixes**: Updated the PayPal client ID to a valid test ID and simplified the  function to resolve initialization errors.
3.  **Ad Error Handling**: Improved error handling for ad network scripts.
4.  **Verification**: Took screenshots and confirmed the site was visually correct, images were loading, and core functionalities (banner, navigation, language selector, chatbot, PayPal in demo mode) appeared functional.
5.  **GitHub Cleanup Attempt**: Upon user request, attempted to remove unnecessary files (e.g., ,  files, old temporary  versions) and update . This local cleanup, however, did not reflect on GitHub due to persistent synchronization challenges.

The user then expressed significant frustration, noting that  files (which the AI had previously considered unnecessary and deleted during cleanup attempts) are critical for multimedia content. The user highlighted that ads, paid galleries, and other improvements were still missing or broken after a Save to GitHub and proposed a new strategy: perfect  (repo ) first, then copy the perfected state to . The AI agreed with this pivot, recognizing the inefficiency of the current approach.
