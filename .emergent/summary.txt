<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's trajectory was characterized by iterative attempts to stabilize and perfect a static website, primarily  (after an initial pivot from ). A persistent challenge was severe GitHub synchronization issues, manifesting as frequent merge conflicts, revertions, and the inability to push changes, forcing manual code transfers and leading to recurring syntax errors () due to unmerged Git conflict markers in .

Despite initial successful rebranding from BeachGirl.pics to IbizaGirl.pics and verification of core UI elements, the AI repeatedly struggled with critical backend integrations and content management. A major misstep was the AI's failure to recognize and utilize existing  files, leading it to generate redundant or incomplete content arrays directly within . This resulted in user frustration regarding wasted time and credits.

Further debugging revealed PayPal was in demo mode, ads were disabled, and content counts (uncensored images, videos) were incorrect. The AI implemented fixes for these, including live PayPal integration, enabling all ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, EroAdvertising, PopAds), and adjusting content logic to simulate rotation from full pools. However, the user's ultimate dissatisfaction stemmed from the recurring Git conflicts and the AI's fundamental misunderstanding of the  files. The trajectory concludes with the user resetting the task, explicitly providing a last working GitHub repo for  and a clear, re-stated list of requirements. The AI performed a hard reset to this remote repository, ready to restart development.

<product_requirements>
The application consists of two static websites, IbizaGirl.pics and BeachGirl.pics, designed to sell premium images and videos. Content is structured into full (free, daily randomized), uncensored (paid, ~100 photos), and uncensored-videos (paid, ~40 videos), with 30% of paid content marked NEW daily. Monetization is via PayPal, supporting one-time purchases and monthly/lifetime subscriptions (€19.99/month, €100/lifetime), with credit/debit options disabled. Multiple ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds) must be integrated. The UI/UX requires blurred premium thumbnails, an Isabella AI chatbot, multi-language support (Spanish, English, French, German, Italian), a tropical-themed age verification, and a hero banner using Great Vibes font. Essential features include Google Analytics, SEO (robots.txt, sitemap.xml), and PWA support. A Premium VIP tier for ad-free access is also required. A Twitter bot for promotion was previously addressed. The overarching goal is to perfect  first, ensuring all features are functional and error-free (PayPal, all ads, correct content galleries/rotation, chatbot, languages, performance), and then adapt this stable version for , resolving persistent GitHub synchronization issues. The current immediate focus is to build  from its last more or less working GitHub state.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Static Site Development**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript for client-side rendering.
-   **Third-Party Integrations**: PayPal SDK for payments, multiple ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds).
-   **Deployment & Version Control**: GitHub for source control, troubleshooting Git conflicts (merge markers, unrelated histories).
-   **Content Management**: Dynamic content loading (or simulation), daily rotation logic based on seed.
-   **UI/UX**: Modals, image/video galleries, lazy loading, smooth scrolling, multilingual support.

<code_architecture>
The application is a single-page static website primarily built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The architecture relies heavily on  for both structure and most of the application's logic.



-   **index.html**: The primary entry point.
    -   **Importance**: Contains the main page structure, content rendering logic, PayPal integration, ad loading, language switching, chatbot, and modals.
    -   **Changes**: Has undergone extensive modifications for IbizaGirl.pics branding (titles, meta, URLs, footer), integrated ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising, PopAds) with real loading (not placeholders), updated PayPal Client ID to  for live mode, and dynamically generates image/video content paths. The previous AI attempted to manage content arrays directly within this file or create new  files, leading to conflicts and errors. It has also been recently cleaned of Git merge conflict markers (, , ).
-   **styles.css**: Global CSS for styling and responsiveness.
    -   **Importance**: Defines the visual theme.
    -   **Changes**: Adapted for IbizaGirl theme, fonts, color schemes, and responsive adjustments.
-   **content-data*.js**: Files intended to hold multimedia content arrays (paths to images/videos).
    -   **Importance**: Critical for defining the paths to multimedia content. The user has repeatedly emphasized their importance and that the arrays *already exist* within these files.
    -   **Changes**: The previous AI engineer initially failed to use these existing files, attempting to recreate content arrays in  or new  files. The latest state, after the HEAD is now at a8309c0 Initial commit, should reflect the version of these files from the  GitHub repository.
-   **uncensored/, uncensored-videos/, full/**: Directories containing the actual multimedia files (webp, mp4).
    -   **Importance**: Store the primary content for the site. The site's logic must correctly reference files within these directories.
-   **8179717.html, f67a56f266e834d596c42122f88bb88d.html, 97ce8adfbeb6e153ef4ebf2566dfeb7d.html, eroads__5f8afe77e5b70fec960d89b314e045a4.html**: Ad network verification files.
    -   **Importance**: Essential for ad network integration and verification.  was corrected from BeachGirl to IbizaGirl.
-   **twitter-bot-ibiza/ (directory)**: Contains the Twitter bot logic.
    -   **Importance**: Automates content promotion. While not directly part of the website, its presence and historical issues with GitHub cleanup are noted.

The core of the application resides in  and its reliance on the content paths defined within the  files, coupled with JavaScript for interactive elements, payments, and ads.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer was battling persistent Git synchronization issues (force push/create branch options appearing instead of a standard push) and critical JavaScript syntax errors caused by unmerged Git conflict markers (, , ) within . The user expressed extreme frustration, highlighting that the AI had wasted time by failing to utilize the existing  files for multimedia content arrays and by introducing code that broke the site or didn't meet requirements.

The AI successfully removed all identified Git conflict markers from , which should resolve the  issues. However, the user then provided a ZIP archive of what they claimed was the last working repo and, in a critical directive, instructed the AI to completely abandon the current local state and instead pull from the  GitHub repository and fix it from there.

The AI subsequently performed a  and HEAD is now at ef78642 Add files via upload to synchronize its local environment with the  branch of , effectively resetting the local codebase to the state of that remote repository. This action cleared all local changes and brought the environment to the last working state as desired by the user. The AI's immediate last action was to list the files in the now-synced  directory to understand the current structure, confirming the presence of  (a key point of contention) and other files. The work is at the very beginning of re-evaluating the codebase based on the pulled GitHub repository and the newly stated detailed requirements from the user.
