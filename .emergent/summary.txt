<analysis>
The previous AI engineer’s work traversed a complex debugging and refactoring path for a static HTML/CSS/JS application. Initially, the AI misinterpreted the project as a React/FastAPI stack, then corrected course to fix an existing static site. The core challenges revolved around persistent functionality failures despite the AI's repeated claims of 100% fixed. Key issues included a missing JuicyAds script, broken content randomization, non-functional PayPal, large thumbnails, and general display issues. The AI engineer employed the  multiple times to diagnose root causes. The work involved extensive  modifications, correcting JavaScript dependencies, fixing file paths, and streamlining the project structure for Vercel deployment. Despite the AI's final claims of complete functionality and readiness for deployment, the trajectory ends with the user stating that issues still persist, indicating a fundamental disconnect between the AI's local verification and the deployed application's state.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a web application for selling images and videos, with specific content categories: full (banners, teasers), uncensored (paid images at €0.10), and uncensored-videos (paid videos at €0.30). Monetization relies on PayPal for one-time and subscription purchases, and integration of ad systems (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising). Content display requires images/videos for banners, galleries, and teasers, with daily randomization (200 uncensored images, 40 uncensored videos). Premium content should have blurred thumbnails and correct pricing overlays, with optimized thumbnail sizes. An interactive AI assistant Isabella is also required. Technically, the application must remain a static HTML/CSS/JS system, compatible with Vercel deployment, and numerous existing errors in the provided codebase needed fixing. The overarching problem was getting the application to function correctly and consistently across all advertised features.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Static Site Development**: Core application built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
-   **Third-Party Integrations**: PayPal SDK for secure payment processing and various ad networks (JuicyAds, ExoClick, Ero-Advertising) for monetization.
-   **Client-Side Content Management**: Dynamic loading and randomization of images and videos using JavaScript, local storage for VIP access.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements**: Blur effects for premium content, responsive design for various devices, and an AI chatbot.
-   **Deployment Strategy**: Vercel compatibility via GitHub integration, requiring a clean root-level file structure.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is primarily a static website, with an initial misinterpretation as a React/FastAPI setup. The logic for dynamic content, UI interactions, and integrations is handled via JavaScript files.



-   **index.html**: Serves as the initial landing page, likely redirecting to . Minimal changes expected.
-   **main.html**: The central application page. It integrates all UI elements, content sections, PayPal buttons, and ad scripts.
    -   **Changes**: Received extensive modifications. Initially fixed script tags and references. Later, a major rewrite (v5.0 CLEAN) to correct ad integration, implement content paths, PayPal, and remove syntax errors (optional chaining, template literals). The final major change involved restoring it from a functional backup () and re-applying fixes to JuicyAds, JavaScript dependencies, and content rendering logic.
-   **styles.css**: Contains global styling for layout, responsiveness, and visual elements.
    -   **Changes**: Initially corrected a CSS rule. Later, the  version was created without proper styles, necessitating a revert and ensuring the original styling rules were present.
-   **main-script.js**: The core client-side JavaScript, orchestrating UI, content loading, and interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Initially refactored to integrate content data. Later, significant changes were made to correctly reference  instead of non-existent , , . It was also updated to hide the loading screen, fix content loading functions (, , , , ), and correct image/video file paths by removing redundant directory names.
-   **content-data*.js (1-6) & content-data-integration.js**: These files contain structured data (image/video paths) and content management logic.
    -   **Changes**: Referenced paths were cleaned, duplication in  was resolved. During the  phase, these were used to generate accurate lists of *existing* files, and  was modified to use these actual lists.  was initially missing and later created as a placeholder or copied from backup.
-   **isabella.js / isabella.css**: New files for the AI chatbot.
    -   **Changes**: Created to implement the chatbot functionality. Functionality confirmed by screenshot.
-   **uncensored/, uncensored-videos/, full/**: Directories storing content.
    -   **Changes**: The content within these directories was validated for existence, and JavaScript arrays were updated to only reference existing files.
-   **f67a56f266e834d596c42122f88bb88d.html, 97ce8adfbeb6e153ef4ebf2566dfeb7d.html, eroads__5f8afe77e5b70fec960d89b314e045a4.html**: Ad verification files.
    -   **Changes**: Ensured their presence for proper ad integration and verification.
-   **ibizagirl-deployable2/**: This was an old backup/alternative version of the application.
    -   **Changes**: It was used as a source to restore a functional  and other JavaScript files when the  version introduced critical errors. It was later explicitly removed from the  directory to ensure a clean Vercel deployment structure.
-   **manifest.json, service-worker.js**: PWA related files.
    -   **Changes**: Their presence was verified for PWA functionality.

<pending_tasks>
The user explicitly stated that the following issues persist despite the AI engineer's claims:
-   Missing videos in the video gallery.
-   PayPal functionality is broken/not working.
-   Thumbnails for uncensored content do not show real blurred content.
-   Images in banner and gallery are not randomized daily from the full folder.
-   Ads (JuicyAds, PopAds, Ero-Advertising, ExoClick) are not displaying or have errors.
-   The  error persists.
-   Gallery con fotos enormes. Imagenes de pago incompletos on thums muy grandes.
-   No hay isabella. DESASTRE!!!

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer performed extensive debugging and restoration, responding to the user's DESASTRE!!! feedback. The AI had just restored the  and critical JavaScript files (, ) from a known working backup () after a previous v5.0 CLEAN version introduced syntax errors and massive display issues.

The latest work focused on:
1.  **Restoring from Backup**: Copied  from  to  (Chat 208).
2.  **Re-fixing JuicyAds**: Moved  calls from inline scripts to deferred JavaScript to avoid  errors (Chat 212-216).
3.  **Restoring JavaScript Dependencies**: Copied all  and  from the backup to  as they were missing (Chat 228).
4.  **Correcting JS References**: Fixed  to  and ensured  was present (Chat 230-234).
5.  **Fixing JavaScript Initialization Logic**: Corrected  to use existing  methods (e.g., , , , ) instead of non-existent global managers (Chat 257-282).
6.  **Hiding Loading Screen**: Added  logic to  to properly reveal content (Chat 266-271).
7.  **Correcting Content Container IDs**: Modified  to use correct HTML element IDs like , , ,  (Chat 305-309).
8.  **Fixing Duplicated Image Paths**: Adjusted , ,  to remove redundant folder names (e.g., ) from content paths (Chat 315-319).
9.  **Reactivating JuicyAds Script**: Re-enabled the JuicyAds script in  after core issues were addressed (Chat 297).
10. **Repository Clean-up**: Deleted the now redundant  backup folder and  to prepare for Vercel deployment (Chat 329-331).

The AI engineer's last successful action was cleaning the repository structure for Vercel deployment and claiming the site is 100% listo para deployment exitoso with all functionalities working, specifically listing banner, galleries, videos, PayPal, ads, and Isabella AI. However, the initial problem statement (and the trajectory's analysis) indicates that despite this claim, the user continues to report issues.
